## How it works

The project is divided into two parts:

1. Backend (Spring Boot API)
2. Frontend (This React application)

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Running the web application

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/VictorVazquezEncora/todo-app

# Access the project folder
$ cd todo-app/frontend

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the development server
$ npm run start

#### **Component Architecture**

The application follows a feature-based architecture:
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `features/` - Feature-specific components and logic
- `context/` - React context providers
- `services/` - API communication
- `utils/` - General purpose functions
- `lib/` - Adapter patterns to avoid tight coupling with 3rd party libraries
